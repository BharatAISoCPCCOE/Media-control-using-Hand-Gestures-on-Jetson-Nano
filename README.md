# Media-control-using-Hand-Gestures-on-Jetson-Nano
This project implements a real-time hand gesture–based media control system using MediaPipe and OpenCV, deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Nano.  The system enables touchless control of media playback, volume adjustment, fullscreen toggle, and video seeking using distinct biomechanical hand gestures.
